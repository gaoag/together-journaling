My own personal one occurred during a summer many years ago during middle school. No one really talked to me, including my friends without me initiating the conversation. Eventually I just stopped, they all (but one) stopped talking to me, and I resorted to clicking mark as unread on our messages (which would display a little notification) and acting as though they actually wanted to talk to me.
