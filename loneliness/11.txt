I thought that I was chasing dreams
While I was walking down those fast streams.
Chasing after love that will never be,
Now I am left stranded in the deep open sea.

Will I ever find a way back to the shore?
All that I ask for is nothing more,
Just someone who can gently take my hand
And walk with me on the soft beach sand.
