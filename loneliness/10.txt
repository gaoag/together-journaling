Have you ever set your heart on someone
Though you didn't stand a chance?
Have you ever wished that someone
Would think the way you do?
Have you ever fallen in love with someone
Who didn't love you too?
Have you ever tried to explain to them
The feelings in your heart,
Only to hear a response
That tears your heart apart?
Have you ever spent so much time with someone,
Even though it hurts inside?
Have you ever tried to save a friendship
By having your feelings hide?
Have you ever wanted that friendly hug to turn into a kiss?
Have you ever wished your heart would stop wishing
For those things that won't come true?
Have you ever wished that that someone would try to love you too?
