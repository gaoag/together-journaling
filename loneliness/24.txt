When we’re young and struggling to find and establish our place in the world, many of us feel as though we’re simply not like other people. It comes as little surprise that Edgar Allan Poe – if we take this lyric poem as a personal expression of his own feelings – felt like this, too:

From childhood’s hour I have not been
As others were—I have not seen
As others saw—I could not bring
My passions from a common spring—
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow—I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone—
And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—

It’s one of the paradoxes of adolescence that everyone goes through exactly the same thing: feeling as though they are different from everyone else.
