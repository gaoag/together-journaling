I'm sitting here alone, my thoughts within the past,
Thinking about you, a love I hoped would last.
Your warm and tender heart that seems so far away,
This yearning deep inside me that I must obey.

Please don't leave me here alone; you must understand
That a lost love is like footsteps in the sand.
So, kiss my soul just one more time; that's all I ask of you.
And heal my heart that aches for you, as only you can do.

The truth is all I want to know; I seek it in your eyes,
But the only thing I see is that the truth is full of lies.
Hold me now; I feel my soul slowly fade away.
Let me know you love me too; your heart I won't betray.

Please don't leave me here alone; you must understand
That a lost love is like footsteps in the sand.
So, kiss my soul just one more time; that's all I ask of you.
And heal my heart that aches for you, as only you can do.

There is no place for me without you by my side.
A world without your love, the pain how can I hide?
I want to taste your lips, to feel your body rush,
And like a starving man, I hunger for your touch.

Please don't leave me here alone; you must understand
That a lost love is like footsteps in the sand.
So, kiss my soul just one more time; that's all I ask of you.
And heal my heart that aches for you, as only you can do.
