When I was a little kid I was completely alone. No friends, mum wasn’t really around and when she was she still wasn’t there. No one seemed to care about me and life just got incredibly hard. I was 9/10, anxiety kicked in big time and I remember I used to put a load of pillows next to me in bed. I would then wrap my duvet around me like it was a persons arm so it felt like someone was hugging me.

I had my own little world I would escape into all the time growing up. I would talk to the people in it. They would ask me how my day was, give me advice, laugh with me, comfort me. I would talk to these people all the time. I know it sounds weird, but when you grow up alone, get badly bullied, you find weird ways to cope.
