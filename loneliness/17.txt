I moved to a new town for university, but had 6 weeks to kill before the first semester started. Those 6 weeks were spent in solitude. I only went outside twice to buy food, and when I didnâ€™t sleep I played single player video games or read books.

Basically had no human interaction at all. Was pretty enjoyable, honestly.
