Quite often when I’m driving or walking by myself I like to give fake tours and talk to myself like there’s someone with me and I’ll point stuff out and talk about it. I rehearse conversations over and over or pretend I’m being interviewed. I especially do this a lot while walking my dog around the neighborhood or walking around town, and it gets a little awkward when someone can tell you’re just walking and talking to yourself. When I was in high school, years ago, when I was extremely lonely I would sometimes pretend I went to a completely different school, sometimes like Hogwarts, and make up stories in my head about the people and things around me to distract myself from my own loneliness. It’s made me start thinking about starting to film myself and start vlogging just for myself because it’ll let me still get to do that but have an actual purpose and tell stories and have it not be so weird.
