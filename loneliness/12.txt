When I was little my parents would be at work while I was at school so my uncle would pick me up. I lived really far from school and was about 8 years old so I really couldn’t leave.

Well one day I’m waiting for my uncle to pick me up and it’s getting late, also it’s realy cold and pretty much everyone had left already so there I am sitting on the sidewalk in the cold. Eventually I just started talking to myself to pass the time and to be less afraid.

My dad ended up picking me up, he was really worried when he got home and didn’t see me there. Turns out my uncle got really drunk and just went to sleep.
