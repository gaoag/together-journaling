Back in middle school, I was very lonely so I became best friends with the tree in my back yard. I would run outside right after school and talk to it for a few hours every day as I climbed it. I told it about my day and it would talk back. I always got really sad in the winter when its leaves were gone so I took the dead leaves off the ground and places them in its branches to keep it warm. I cried a lot when we moved a couple years later. Everyone thought I was crying because I missed the house, but I was actually going to miss my tree.
