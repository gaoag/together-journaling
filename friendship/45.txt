There is this little girl who stopped me from running because she wanted to know if there were any little girls in the neighborhood she could play with. When I told her I didn't know, she asked me to play with her. She said she could follow me on her bike and we could race down the hills. It was sweet but I'm an adult and I had other obligations that day but I gave her as much time as I could. Unfortunately we did not become best friends but she will stop by my house to see if I want to go running with her.|_|/u/brokenStrings8, on Reddit
