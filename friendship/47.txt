Nine years ago my best friend and I had a falling out and stopped speaking to each other. That was in 2010. In 2015 I was diagnosed with a condition that required serious surgery and I was alone at university. I called her and without hesitation she flew to my city to go with me to the hospital and stayed with me for a few days after. Now we live in the same city in bordering neighbourhoods and are pretty much like sisters again. Love stories are often about romantic partners, but friendship can be just as special and powerful.|_|/u/1809139 on Reddit
