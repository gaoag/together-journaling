My best friend and I were both in marching band. I played clarinet, and she was color guard. We first met when both our schools played at the same exposition. She was in full guard costume and makeup and hanging halfway out of a school bus window to talk to me. We've been platonic soulmates ever since.|_|/u/FearOrRegret on Reddit
