This new kid got on my bus in the 7th grade, and sat near me. Not too long after getting settled he just stood up and asked aloud if anyone else plays Runescape. I responded with "Yeah, every now and then." For the rest of the ride, he talked about nothing but Runescape. Over ten years later and with an ocean between us, he still talks about nothing but that game.|_|/u/LordofBiscuits on Reddit
