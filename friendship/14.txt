Friendship, to me is one of the most important things in life. We all need someone who loves us, supports us and comforts us when we’re down. And I’m happy I get to have this. In fact, my friends are my most important treasures in life. But there’s always that one best friend you feel comfortable with, someone who you know you can tell anything to and that that person will never judge or tell anyone about your secrets. I think trust is one of the top qualities one needs in a friendship. I think there also has to be some common interests, but then again, you can’t both like exactly the same things… The friendship should be interesting. When you get in a fight with your best friend I think that you need to be in a friendship where you know that this person, no matter how mad you two are you’ll always end up sorting it out. And this person no matter what will always be there for you. If something’s upsetting you, your friend should always be able to make you smile, to cheer you up. Then again we come back to trust, which to me, like I said is the most important quality in a friendship. If there’s secrets, no trust I don’t think the relationship would be able to maintain itself.
