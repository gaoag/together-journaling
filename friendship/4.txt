One night after teaching a late class, I found a sticky note on the window of my car. It read “You are beautiful inside and out” and featured a little heart. I never did find out which one of my friends left it for me, but it is still on my dashboard and means more than anything to me.|_|Jennie Berglund, Burnsville, Minnesota, for Reader's Digest
