I began writing him letters. I may have been nearly 30 years younger than he was, but this was one path I had walked before him. I sent him portions of my book in progress, and he ended up writing a foreword for that book.

I write him a long letter at least once a month. I ask for his advice on writing, life, faith, even dating. He answers by e-mail, never failing to say exactly what I need to hear. Iâ€™ve saved all of his e-mails, more than 125 of them. I can honestly say that an 87-year-old man is one of my best friends.|_|Mary Potter Kenyon, Dubuque, Iowa, to the Reader's Digest
