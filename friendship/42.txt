I met Connie in 1976, when we were both competing in a tae kwon do tournament. Both red belts, we had been paired to compete against each other. As we sat next to each other waiting for our match, Connie began to talk to me. She was friendly and had a wonderful smile. I was struck by how nice she was. Then we got up to compete. Connie suddenly put on the fiercest face you can imagine. This terrified me. Out of self-preservation, I proceeded to kick her in the head—twice—and won the match.

Despite this, Connie and I became close friends. And despite our many differences, we have remained friends throughout the last 43 years. Connie is Black and I am White. She was raised in a big city and I was brought up in a small town. Connie is a liberal Democrat and I am a conservative Republican.

Connie now lives on the East Coast and I live in northern Wisconsin, but we keep in touch through social media. One of her favorite things to do is to introduce me as her bestie who put a foot in her face.|_|Susan Liss, Summit Lake, Wisconsin, to the Reader's Digest
