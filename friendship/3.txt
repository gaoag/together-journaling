my three closest friends (Miranda, Rachel, and Johlandi) and I keep in touch via group texting. We share daily struggles, complaints, triumphs, and, most of all, laughs. These special ladies respond nonjudgmentally to whatever I tell them, allowing me to be as vulnerable as I please. Conversely, itâ€™s a blessing to help them through their difficult times. Having such receptive friends has taught me that life is more fun and meaningful when I share myself with others.|_|Lauren Young, Rockingham, Virginia, for Reader's Digest
