We are the same age. And we both like to sing. Thatâ€™s where the similarities stop. The differences go on and on. So, why are we friends? Because we share our ethics, our faith, and our music. We love each other for being ourselves and for being good people with good hearts. When we meet for breakfast, I show up in my brightly colored top, and she comes in with her hair tied back and her thrift store jeans. I sit and sip my coffee with flavored creamer while she enjoys her glass of plain water, and we talk for hours. We just work. She is one of my favorite people.|_|Sue Wallace, Chesterfield, Missouri
