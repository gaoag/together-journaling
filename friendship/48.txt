My best friend is a little Leslie Knope! Seriously! She works in public service, she's absolutely the most genuinely GOOD person that I know, and she's the best planner in the world- making you feel so special every time you get to spend time with her. We live in separate states, but visit one another pretty frequently. I got to go see her last weekend and visit with her & her 6month old baby, her husband, and her doggies. She's currently running for a State Senate Seat in her state. So I got to be her cheerleader and partner all weekend, as she spoke at events, canvassed in different neighborhoods, and attended events while promoting herself to her community members. I am just SO proud of her, I was beaming all weekend long! I felt so special every time she introduced me to someone new as her best friend, thinking to myself, how did I get so lucky to have such an amazing woman as my best friend?? I love her so!
