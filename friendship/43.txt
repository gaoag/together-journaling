That’s how I came to learn the truth: Bernice wanted those particular leaves for their size, not their color. Bernice told me that she had never seen leaves so large and that was why she was picking them up.

It made for a great joke, and we laughed about it all year as we planned her next group’s Know America experience. We quickly became close friends, and we’ve remained close friends ever since.

Last year, I sent leaf stickers to Bernice for her birthday. In return, she sent me a copy of the book Last of the Breed by her favorite author, Louis L’Amour. Inside, she had placed a leaf sticker on every sentence in the book that mentioned a leaf or leaves, 34 stickers in total.|_|Ron Drum, Drums, Pennsylvania, for the Reader's Digest
