I moved out to a small rural town for grad school a little over a year ago, and between grad school and the rural population, I hadn't really made any local friends. My birthday was coming up, and for some reason this year I was kind of bummed about not being able to do a get-together for it. I never did parties before, but this time it bothered me. And I never even said anything about it, but two weeks before my birthday, two of my best friends who live seven hours away in another country called me and asked if I had any birthday plans. They, on their own - not even conferring with each other! - had decided to make that trip out to me for a long weekend. One of them reached out to family and was able to get a sailboat for a weekend, so my birthday went from videogames by myself to my two best friends traveling hours to come sailing with me for a weekend. I cried so damn hard; I love them so much. It also turned out that by pure chance that weekend in the town we went to was both the weekend of an Art Festival and the local Pride Festival! We'd had no idea but it was perfect!|_|/u/all_iswells on Reddit
