Tina is my best friend. She is also my husband’s ex-wife. When we first met, she and Bob had been divorced for more than 12 years, and he and I had been dating only a short time. We didn’t become close friends right away. It took years of getting to know each other and seeing each other for who we truly are. We’ve stood together through difficult times and family hardships. We’ve shared wonderful holiday celebrations, and we were together to see the birth of our first grandson. Even though we now live 1,500 miles apart, Bob and I still vacation with her and her husband, and Saturday is our “phone call” day. She has brought so much joy and love into my life. I don’t know what I’d do without my best friend. |_|Jana Fisher, Port Charlotte, Florida, to the Reader's Digest
