Last December, before work, I stopped at a deli and ordered an everything bagel with cream cheese. It was toasty warm, and I couldnâ€™t wait to dig in. But as I left the store, I noticed an older indigent gentleman sitting at the bus stop. Knowing it would probably be his only warm meal of the day, I gave him the bagel. But all was not lost for me. Another customer from the deli offered me half of her bagel. I was so delighted because I realized that in one way or another, we are all looked after.
