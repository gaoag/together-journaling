Whenever I visited Ruth at the rest home, I’d always greet her with, “Good morning, sweetie.” She, in turn, would say, “Heeeyyyyyy! I’ve been missing you.” For as long as I knew Ruth, she greeted me with “I’ve been missing you,” even if I’d just seen her that morning. And when I’d leave, it was always, “Come back!” As if you need more of a reason to have friends, these facts prove that friends are healthy for us.

Ruth was my first friend in South Carolina. Our house was built on her property. I went over and introduced myself one day and told her that I’m out every morning and if she liked, I could bring her newspaper to her door. She said, “Well, I suppose that would be all right.” It wasn’t long after that I started bringing her the afternoon mail and cookies too. And soon I started taking her to the library, doctors, and the store.

At the rest home, if Ruth’s breakfast tray was ready, I’d pick it up. I knew how she liked her grits, with just a bit of butter and salt, and that she really, really liked orange juice and always got two glasses. After a bit, it would be time to go. She’d give me a kiss and tell me to “come back!”|_|Janet Alden, Inman, South Carolina, for Reader's Digest
