They’re the few people who accept silence over conversation.
A relationship like this denies silly promises and persuasion.

You don’t feel the need to second guess thoughts or measure words.
Their love comes in wholes, not halves, not thirds.

They’re the ones that guide you through when fate takes a turn.
Fights, small and large, end in forgiveness, never a burn.

You forget about first impressions and the feelings they brought.
You’re grateful for who they are and you forgive ’em for what they’re not.
