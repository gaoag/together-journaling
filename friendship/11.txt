A person who will listen and not condemn
Someone on whom you can depend
They will not flee when bad times are here
Instead, they will be there to lend an ear.
They will think of ways to make you smile
So you can be happy for a while
When times are good and happy thereafter
They will be there to share the laughter
Do not forget your friends at all
For they pick you up when you fall.
Do not expect to just take and hold
Give friendship back, it is pure gold.
